Good day,

This is a small document will explain the shared components between all scripts.
Inside each map there is a document similar to this one explaining the shared components
of the scripts below etc.

FILE PLACEMENT:
Files can be placed in their own folder, only when you reached the end of the
original file structure. Exception on this rule is the custom-folder.

media
 | - items
 | - locations
 |    \ - custom*
 | - monsters
 |    \ - custom*
 | - npc
 |    \ - custom*
 | - player
 |    | - descriptions
 |    | - perks
 |    \ - stats
 | - quests
 |    \ - custom*
 \ - bodyDescription 


SHARED COMPONENTS:

UID: <Unique IDentifier>:String
	This is a identifier, made by the author of the script. One should take care not
	to make duplicate UID's, when this happens the script which is read first with that
	UID will be accepted, the following will not. A warning will be shown when a 
	double has been found.
	
	Example of making an identifier:
	"[language].[shortname-author].[shortname-title]"
	Example: "en.B3G1.TWaking1
	
	Adivised is when using complex questline to include the questarc-shortname

NAME: <name>:string
	Every script has a form of a name: quest name, item name, npc name, body(race)...
	Here duplicates are allowed, unlike UID, and won't affect the reading proccess of
	the other script-files

TYPE: <enum>:string
	Some scripts require a type, this is to identify what kind of object you try to make.
	What you can use will be explained in each guidline<type>.txt file inside each folder.

WHEN USING CUSTOM:
Make sure you are pointing to the right script. In each custom-folder is a template available
for refference.
